bzexport: a Mercurial extension for attaching patches from a
  Mercurial repository to bugzilla from the command line.

INSTALLING
----------

1) Clone this repository somewhere on your local machine:
   hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/users/tmielczarek_mozilla.com/bzexport/
2) Edit your ~/.hgrc and add the following to enable the extension:
   [extensions]
   bzexport = /path/to/bzexport/bzexport.py

NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS
----------------------

bzexport attempts to be clever and borrow your Bugzilla login cookies
from your Firefox profile. This does not work on the windows binary
releases of Mercurial, as shipped with MozillaBuild, so you'll need
to add your username and password to your .hgrc as described below.
(The technical reason is that the binary Mercurial releases use
py2exe to freeze a Python install into the hg binary, which leaves
out modules that aren't used, including the sqlite3 module which
bzexport needs to read cookies.sqlite.)

EDITING OPTIONS
---------------

bzexport options can be added in a [bzexport] section in your .hgrc.
Currently supported options are:
[bzexport]
# Your bugzilla login, only necessary if bzexport can't locate
# your Firefox profile, or if you're on Windows using
# a binary Mercurial release.
username = username@example.com

# Your bugzilla password, see above.
password = secret

# URL to the Bugzilla server to use. The default is
# https://bugzilla.mozilla.org.
bugzilla = http://bugzilla.example.com/

# URL to the BzAPI server to use. The default is
# https://api-dev.bugzilla.mozilla.org/latest/
api_server = http://bzapi.example.com/latest/
